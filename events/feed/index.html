<p>The word apocalypse comes from the word for revelation. The climate crisis, much like the COVID pandemic, is revealing what many have long known: that the luxuries of the few depend on the suffering of the many. But all these crises we face also reveal the possibility that the world can change. It doesn’t have to be this way. Together and from the ground up we can build the world we want and deserve. Join speakers from across the global movement for justice in the opening rally for From the Ground Up as we envision a pathway out of permanent crisis towards a better world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="color: #3f43aa;"><b>This is an interactive event, please register below to receive the zoom link.</b></div>
<p>When COP26 fails, we need to have already created a grassroots up global alternative for making decisions together. We see assemblies (peoples and citizens) as a means to disrupt and replace this broken political system which is unable to solve the crises it has created &#8211; and to build solidarity and empathy in our communities and across the world.</p>
<p>Grassroots to Global is an unfolding collaborative process building from individual conversations where we deeply listen &#8211; putting aside the idea that our issue is the most important one &#8211; to local, national and eventually global peoples and citizens assemblies.</p>
<p>We are capable of creating so much better ways of making decisions together than those we currently have. Join us to hear more, share your responses and help shape this process with us.</p>

<p>Next year will see huge battles over recovery packages, economic reactivation and attempt to maintain the status quo. These battles will determine whether we deepen the state of permanent crisis to the point of no return or lay the foundations to guarantee everyone the right to a dignified life and achieve climate justice. Given the immense resistance of political elites, and the inertia of the status quo, progressive social movements need to rapidly build significant power and put vigorous energy into developing collective visions. In this closing session of From The Ground Up we will lay out the next 12 months of escalating action, grounded mobilisation and hope.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through taking part in and supporting new fossil fuel projects in the Middle East, Western powers like the EU and US destabilize the region and entrench Israeli apartheid regime, including the legitimization of decades of de facto and planned de jure annexation of Palestinian territory. The US, the EU, Italian companies and more are supporting gas and electricity projects that solidify Israel as a regional energy supplier; giving it a geopolitical stronghold. Not only are people&#8217;s lives and the stability of the region threatened by these energy interventions, but food security, dwelling security and more are threatened by the climate crisis that these energy projects escalate. Hear from campaigners from Palestine and Europe about how neoliberalism neocolonialism and colonialism play out in huge energy projects like the EuroAsia Interconnector and Eastmed pipeline.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We rapidly have to phase-out fossil fuels but there is a major obstacle for the clean energy transition that hardly anyone knows about: There are more than 2,600 investment treaties and trade agreements that protect foreign investors’ assets, including fossil fuel investments. They enable foreign investors, including shareholders, to sue states over measures that harm their profits, even for climate policies. They can claim vast amounts in compensation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several fossil fuel companies have filed or threatened compensation claims against states. For example, the owner of a coal-fired power station in the Netherlands is claiming compensation for the Dutch coal phase-out law. TransCanada demanded $15 billion from the US for halting the Keystone XL oil pipeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list of cases is long and very likely to grow as states are putting their climate commitments into practice. What could this mean for the coal, oil and gas phase-out? What can be done to break the power of fossil fuel firms to obstruct the transition to clean energy?</span></p>

<p>Covid-19 has brought into consciousness the deep pre-existing health inequalities. It has highlighted how our health is shaped by the wider social, economic and environmental conditions in which we live. At the roots of health injustice is an extractive, economic system that serves to concentrate power in the pursuit of profit through the exploitation of people and the planet. This is the same system that is driving climate breakdown.</p>
<p>This panel discussion seeks to reflect on the connections between health and the climate, the public health impacts of extractive industries and how the Green New Deal can also be a Public Health New Deal.<br />
We will be hearing from voices across the world as to how we build the health movement for transformative climate justice. There will be space for questions and deeper reflection for how we organise from the ground up in the lead up to COP 26. Join us as we explore why health justice means climate justice.</p>

<p>Forest communities worldwide are on the frontlines of protecting and conserving our forests and of struggling against the impacts of monoculture tree plantations, tree burning in power stations for bioenergy, the promotion of ‘nature-based solutions’ by big polluters and other false solutions.</p>
<p>Please join Biofuelwatch and Global Forest Coalition for this session linking struggles and campaigns from groups around the world to protect forests, wildlife, communities and the climate from bioenergy and monoculture tree plantations. The speakers will give information about linking communities who are facing threats to forests from different countries and regions. The session will also give an overview of the threats to forests from tree burning in power stations and the promotion of &#8216;nature based solutions&#8217; by big polluters.</p>
<p>We will hear about the environmental injustices of wood pellet production and industrial tree plantations and learn about grassroots and community-led efforts around the world to conserve and protect forests and biodiversity. We will also discuss how community groups in different countries are implementing gender-responsive and rights-based approaches as alternatives to plantations and tree burning and how these approaches can help achieve climate, social and environmental justice.</p>
<p>We’ll have time for discussion and a Q &amp; A with the speakers. Everyone is welcome!</p>
